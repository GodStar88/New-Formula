STEP4) Finally 157 = 58 check for 9 same is 1
STEP5) 2, 55 so is DOWN
STEP6) Check 2, 55, 4 for 9 and exact same is 0
STEP7) Check 57, 6, 59 for 9 and exact same is 1
STEP8) Check 2, 55, 4 breakdown same is 4
STEP9) Check 53, 57 for 9, 1 same is 2
STEP10) Check 68, 42  for 9, 13 same is 1
STEP11) Check 63, 47  for 9, 13 same is 4

Date : 20, 28, 80, 9, 89, 90, 4, 94, 23, 27, 50
STEP14) Check 4 breakdown same with date same is 2
STEP14) Check 13 breakdown same with date same is 7
STEP15) Check 52, 53, 93, 25, 29, 62, 63, 23, 24, 35, 102, 103, 31 for 9 same is 2
So total is 14, UP
STEP1) Check 4, 5, 9, 14 for exact same, so same is  0
STEP2) Check 4, 5, 9, 14 for 9, so same is  1
STEP3) Check 14 and 1 for breakdown same, so same is 0
STEP4) 14 nearest 9 is 18
Check 4 with 4, 5, 9 exactsame and Check with nearest 18 for breakdown same, so same is 1
STEP5) Check 15, 13 for 9 and for exactsame 4, 5, 9, 14 same is 0
